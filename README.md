We will build the MT 5 platform, connect the sales assistant to it, and I will explain to you how the sales assistant works. UAK only you will be able to trade when poyete all printsyp, you will go to a real account. The sales assistant wakes you up showing you.–¢o begin with, we will start learning on a demo account. as soon as you understand how the trading robot works and you practice it you can immediately go to the broker and open a real account of 250 dollars.

Let's select a broker. We wake up to trade on MT5. Download the MT5 app to your computer or phone, You need to install a robot and you need to learn how to trade with this robot. Before he learns to trade, he needs a broker. He passes your requests to the market; this is the intermediary. It connects when everything is set up when you know how to trade !! most importantly, a trading robot assistant that automatically helps you trade at a profit.

Need time to check everything out and test the robot

How to use a trading robot, it wakes up to show the levels of large players and we wake up to follow the trainer with them and make money on it. all this robot's algorithm is aimed at finding a big player and when he finds it gives us a signal and we get money. In the future, you will be able to constantly make a profit, learn how to operate a robot.

tf m30 - confident trend movement for a decrease within the day + the last candles also confidently show the offer. At the moment, there are approaches to support, so I think there may be rollbacks, and on these rollbacks, I would just enter the current offer from the sales side

tf m30 within the day there was a good demand for the price for an increase, after which the price reached its local maximum and the price continues to move along a downward trend, now the resistance area is being retested, I will consider an entry for a fall based on the potential of price movement

if the price goes higher we overlap from the next level

I will describe on timeframe m30, we note that today the price moves in a rather narrow range, but on the last day it is clear that there was a good demand for the increase, you can see from the candlesticks that the price is now approaching the support area with uncertainty, with such a price movement I consider the entry by the trend of the previous day from the level up

take your time let the price reach the second level

The log for your EURUSD signal (UTC time of entry / price of entry / time of close / price of close)
2. This kind of EA might be ok on dollar pairs.
3. I like UKBrentOTC and GoldOTC and SilverOTC assets- Because pay off is always 92%. UKBrentOTC is most stable asset

## There is 3 strategies you can trade on pocket option
1. SMS for a break in BTC price
2. Wait for a few minutes - enter for 3-5 minutes
3. You need to tell how to send you that signal - SMS to the phone? Telegram? Any other way?
4. Trade crypto-peaks - I trade it every day and I win. Every day.

## Money and risk management 
1. The simplest rule of money management:
a. The maximum transaction amount must be less than 5% of the deposit
Here's a simple formula for how to calculate it:
Max. transaction amount = (deposit * 5) / 100
For example, if your deposit is $ 300, then the maximum amount that you can afford to risk is:
(300 * 5) / 100 = $ 15
I emphasize that 5% is the maximum amount you can risk. With conservative work, it can be even less, say, 1-2%.
üí∞ As a rule, the larger the size of your deposit, the lower the percentage should be in order to eliminate the psychological effects of risking large amounts.

2. The basics of trading so that you start working correctly without errors.
a. The market is unstable today it can give you money, and tomorrow there will be a protracted correction, you will see it and start to panic and leave the position, and the market will take and continue to go in your direction and where you could earn and did not earn because you left. 
b. you need to be able to wait for the market this is waiting for the exact point of entry.
c. if you are on my team then you will become one of the best traders. everything just needs to be trained, it's not easy, but we earn very good money.
d. Risk management is management decisions designed to reduce the likelihood of an adverse outcome and minimize potential losses.

3. 3 rules of psychological risk management:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Stopping trades for several hours / day after 3-4 unsuccessful trades in a row.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Then 2-3 positive trades per demo
3Ô∏è‚É£ Return to real trading.

4. üí∞ With Risk Management, we control our entire deposit. EXAMPLE:
a. We earn 20% of the deposit per day and finish trading
b. We lose 20% and end trading for the day
c. Now it is important for me to teach you from the very beginning. now I will show you what signals I have. you will receive them when you start to understand what the market is
d No need to trade this is an example !! Currency pair GBP CHF

I'm working out a new strategy on the MT4 platform, I need to test it. I work for a week and I will give it to you, you can easily earn from 350 dollars a day. You look at the signals, you enter a trade and when the price gains profit, you exit the trade yourself and press the close button. This is much better than binary options. In this MT4 terminal, we ourselves choose when to close deals, so we always get profit !! You will like it i promise

### This document will discuss the Crypto Peaks Trade Environment signal providers (winning) trading strategies to the way to play the signals setup flow that occurs on the Trade platform. The steps are as follows:

To play the signals setup flow that occurs on the Trade platform - and create (winning) trading strategies the 7 key candlestick reversal patterns should look like the following: 



## Trader Tips Common candlestick reversal patterns - The simplest possible scenario
1. Playing stock signals on pocket options
A. This is the group: (screenshot)
B. When you get a signal - wait for Star pattern. If signal down wait for evening star. If signal up wait for morning star. (picture 1) current picture. (picture 2) how it looks on pocket options
C. If the star happens (close to the signal) - make a bet for 1-3-5 minutes
D. If the star does not happen in 5 minutes - don't bet
2. Then will add more complex stuff - after you do a first trade by yourself, you will get the money. Used this guide and play it on po. We need somebody trading the signals. You have the signal, instructions, and support. It took me 7 day to beak stocks on pocket option, stocks is trivial. Because you have signals. We traded them it's the easiest, you just look for a pattern and win, it's *really* easy. Other trading is much harder, You need to practice on simple stuff. Then get up at 6.30 and wait for a signals. Look for patterns, and only act when you see the pattern, then you need to take a screenshot, and that's your product.

## The basic ones are the stars 
1. The cross-like stars are very strong
2. Three doji stars  + + +
3. Only not in a row, but the middle one above two or below two
Start with those and then will go to more complex patterns

# To play the signals setup flow that occurs on the Trade platform. The steps are as follows:

1. The pocket options UI, There is a star pattern, Can only play the stars at first, they are the simplest and they work
2. Need to capture a screenshots from pocket options so that examples are real.The signals go to the telegram group
3. Just two up stars, Evening and morning
4. Two down stars is enough, only star image makes sense
